If left blank, \nthis will default to https://github.com/abstractionhq/gallery-gateway/archive/master.zip\n\nThe script will:\n- Create a MySQL database if one does not exist (and set the character encoding to UTF-8)\n- Download this project's source from GitHub\n- Install and build the frontend\n- Install and build the backend\n- Migrate the database tables\n- Start the backend using Supervisor\n\nIf the backend fails to start, the script will still complete, you can check if it is running by \nentering the command\n```sh\nsudo supervisorctl status all\n```\n\n### Troubleshooting Common Errors\n#### /usr/bin/mysql -u root -p gives command not found error\nThis may mean that mysql has already been added to the path. In this case, try the command.\n```sh\nmysql -u root -p\n```\nThe shell deploy script will still function properly in this case.\n\nIf this does not work, mysql may be installed somewhere else, or may not be installed at all.\n\n\n#### The Supervisor backend is not running\nYou are likely missing one of the required keys. You can check the \nsupervisor logs found in `/opt/node/gallerygateway/log.txt` for more information\n\n\n \n\n## Maintenance\n\nBecause the JavaScript community tends to move faster than other language communities, this app will require regular maintenance to make sure it can run on the current LTS [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) runtime. Additionally, [npm](http://npmjs.com/) packages this app depends on should be periodically monitored, including updating to their latest stable versions (possibly even switching packages if the current maintainer abandons support).\n\n"}
