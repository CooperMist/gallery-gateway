We use the testing libraries [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) and [Enzyme](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/).\n\n## Deployment\n\nThis app assumes that the backend GraphQL API will be deployed at `https://gallerygateway.rit.edu/backend`.\n\nWe use [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) to compile our application. Our Webpack configuration files can be found in `config/`\n\nTo build the app for production, run `yarn run build`. This will create a `dist/` folder with the compiled output files.\n\nTo test that the compiled app is working correctly, you'll need to host the assets on a static server. The npm package [`serve`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve) can be used to do this locally.\n\nIn production, we host our static files using [nginx](https://nginx.org/en/). You can find our nginx config in our `deploy/` folder.\n"}
