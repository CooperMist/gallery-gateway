There must be a user in the sql database named 'gallerygateway'\n    1. To create a new user, start a mysql session with\n        ```sh\n        sudo /usr/bin/mysql -u root -p\n        ```\n\n    2. You can then check if the user already exists with\n        ```sh\n        SELECT User, Host FROM mysql.user;\n        ```\n\n    3. Create a new user in the database named gallerygateway (if one does not already exist)\n        ```sh\n        CREATE USER 'gallerygateway' IDENTIFIED BY '<password>';\n        ```\n        Replacing \\<password\\> with your user password\n\n2. In the top level directory, you must add a file called `mysql_password.txt` \n   containing, on the first line, the password for the gallerygateway sql user\n   that was just created\n\n3. Provide the MySQL database password, RSA keys used for JWT authentication (see below)\n\n    ```sh\n    cd /opt/node/gallerygateway/keys\n    sudo openssl genrsa -out private.key 4096\n    sudo openssl rsa -in private.key -outform PEM -pubout -out public.key\n    ```\n    \n4. Add the the Identity Provider Certificate (idp_cert.pem) to /opt/node/gallerygateway/keys.\n   Instructions on creating a self signed certificate can be found [here](https://wiki.shibboleth.net/confluence/display/CONCEPT/SAMLKeysAndCertificates#SAMLKeysAndCertificates-SAMLKeysandCertificates)\n"}
