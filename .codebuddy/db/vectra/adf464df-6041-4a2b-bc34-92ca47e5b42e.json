In development, our preferred method is to run them using [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/).\n\n*Note: Docker desktop is only available on Unix systems, as a result, the project may need to be run on a virtual machine. For this iteration of the project, we used a Linux VM running on [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/), however, most of these steps can also be completed on MacOs*\n\n### Installation\n\n1. Install dependencies: `npm install`\n2. Copy the default environment variables: `cp .env-sample .env`\n3. Generate keys for JWT authentication: `npm run keygen`\n4. Build & start the MySQL and SimpleSAMLphp Docker containers: `cd docker && docker-compose up -d && cd ..`\n5. Copy the test SAML IDP's Cert into `keys/idp_cert.pem`. You can find it here: https://github.com/kristophjunge/docker-test-saml-idp/blob/master/config/simplesamlphp/server.crt\n6. Migrate the database: `npm run migrate`\n7. [Optional] Seed the database with users & demo data: `npm run seed`\n8. Start the server: `npm run start`\n9. The API will now be running on `http://localhost:3000`\n"}
