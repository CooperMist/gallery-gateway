{"chunk":3,"numChunks":4,"fileHash":"vi9HWsUnM6hf2pJXeMP8MDciA0rPZCQZ+TBXJJcZnlo=","filePath":"backend/README.md","content":"We use [Backpack](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/backpack) to compile our application into a single file. To build the API for production, run `npm run build`. This will create a `build/` folder with a compiled `main.js` output file.\n\nYou can then run this file with Node: `node main.js`\n\nThe frontend expects the API to be deployed to `https://gallerygateway.rit.edu/backend`. We use [nginx](https://nginx.org/en/) to proxy requests (and strip `/backend` from incoming requests). You can find our nginx config in our `deploy/` folder.\n\nYou'll need to have `keys/` and `uploads/` folders created relative to where you deploy the `main.js` file. You'll have to create RSA keys for JWT authentication and provide the production SAML IDP Cert and put these in the `keys/` folder. Any file uploads (and thumbnails) will be stored in the `uploads/` folder.\n\nThe production MySQL database should be >= v5.7 and should be configured to use the `utf8mb4` character-set. You can see an example configuration in our `docker/` folder.\n\nYou can use `npm run migrate` to migrate the MySQL database. If you need more sophisticated database management scripts (eg. rollback), run `npm run sequelize` to access the Sequelize command-line tools.\n"}
