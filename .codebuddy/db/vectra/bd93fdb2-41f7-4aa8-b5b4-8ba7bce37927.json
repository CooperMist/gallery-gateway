We have found that the easiest way to install and switch to different node verions is by using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/blob/master/README.md)\n\n### npm run migrate fails with a timeout error\nThis will occur from time to time, especially on a slower virtual machine. This problem will likely be resolved by simply re-running the command a few times. If this continues to happen, you can try restarting docker, or restarting your VM.\n\n### npm run migrate or npm run start fails with another error\nnpm migrate often fails when the wrong versions of certain packages are being used. Make sure you are running a node version >=8 and < 12. Once you are sure you are on the right version, try deleting your `/gallery-gateway/backend/node_modules` directory (yes this is okay to do, it will be regenerated), then run npm install again.\n\n### npm run seed fails\nThis may occur if you are not connected to the internet, or, on occasion, if one of the sample image urls is taken down. In the case of the latter, you must update the failing URL in `/gallery-gateway/backend/db/seeds/20180415220000-seed-demo.js`.\n\nIn either case, unfortunately, the seed operations cannot be rolled back if they fail half way through, which will cause future seed operations to continue to fail. If an `npm run seed` fails, you will likely need to take down the database with \n`cd docker && docker-compose down && cd ..`, then repeat steps 4 and 6 of the deployment process.\n\n## Deployment\n\n"}
