However, since we currently rely on [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) to transpile down to what's supported in major browsers and Node, Babel may need to be periodically updated. Ideally, Babel could be removed when the language features we're using are [supported natively](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es2016plus/) in all major browsers and Node.\n"}
