Students can submit works for consideration during an open call, and a panel of RIT faculty jurors vote on which art will be displayed in the gallery at this show. Currently, SPAS has been paying for and using a software as a service product, [CaFÉ](https://www.callforentry.org/), to facilitate this process; however, frustrations with CaFÉ’s difficult-to-use interface and poor user-experience for both administrative and student workflows has led them to seek custom replacement software which better fits their use case and work process.\n\nGallery Gateway is this custom replacement software.\n\nIn addition to it's use for art showcases, Gallery Gateway has also been employed to facilitate in the scholarship selection process. In the current process, scholarship applications are reviewed by judges manually inspecting art pieces, which must be printed out by the students themselves. Gallery Gateway will facilitate this process by condensing all of the scholarship pieces into a single place, allowing for easier judging while also saving students the cost of printing.\n\n### Team\n\nGallery Gateway was built as a Senior Project for RIT's [Software Engineering Undergraduate Program](http://www.se.rit.edu/).\n\n"}
